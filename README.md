# Adam-Kotter-Code
My repository for showcasing my different coding projects, divided into school projects, personal projects, and work projects. As of this writing I am in the process of cleaning up my file system, so some files may have incomplete descriptions or appear in the wrong place.


## Personal Projects

### work_from_home
This is a productivity-tracking program designed to help people with mental or emotional health issues to work from home. This project uses self-reported data to recommend more effective work habits.
- Session: This is the central data-gathering interface for the program.
- Output: This folder holds the saved data once it's gathered.

### Book_of_Mormon_Linguistics
This is a project for analyzing the linguistic differences between speakers in The Book of Mormon. It primarily uses Markov chains to simulate the speech of a given speaker. As of now, speech differences must be analyzed manually instead of statistically.
- bom_utility: A file for miscellaneous functions. Currently only contains a function for getting a list of prepositions.
- book_of_mormon_words: The primary file for this project.
- BoM_by_Speaker_parsed: A file that contains the text of The Book of Mormon organized by speaker.

### RPG
This is a collection of files I'm using to create a text-based RPG in Python.
- Adam_Avatar: A saved character from tests of my RPG. This one is essentially equivalent to "God Mode."
- Battle Arena: The main file for gameplay of the RPG so far, consisting mostly of fights between characters. Later updates may involve a larger super file expanding gameplay to more exploratory things and including this file as a subset of the larger gameplay.
- Ghook_Orc: A saved character from tests of my RPG.
- Ghook_Orc_1: A saved character from tests of my RPG.
- Gimli_Dwarf: A saved character from tests of my RPG.
- Gimli_Dwarf_1: A saved character from tests of my RPG.
- Things: A file for storing information about the various items that can be used in the RPG.
- Tokens: A file for storing information about the various effects or "buffs" that can be placed on characters.

### Other
- Binary Converter: A file for converting real numbers into IEEE 754 representation. I wrote this mainly to make completeing a particular Applied and Computational Math assignment easier.
- Biology Life: A simple (and incomplete) game for modeling evolutionary fitness as a function of energy investment choices.
- Dice Modeler: A file for plotting the statistical probabilities of rolling certain amounts using different combinations of dice. Originally designed to make strategizing easier in roleplaying games.
- Evolution: An attempt at practicing with genetic algorithms.
- Planet Chooser: A statistical modeling game based on the mobile game "Seed Ship."
- Population Model: A file for modeling population growth using various different methods.


## School Projects
This is a collection of assignments I've completed for my Applied and Computational Math classes. It does not represent a full collection of what I've done.
- Linear Transformations: An assignment for practicing applications of linear transformations.
- Linked Lists: An assignment for practicing with different data structures.
- Markov Chains: An assignment for practicing using Markov Chains. I added several files of my own to practice more and create funny paragraphs and phrases that sound like my words or the words of others.
- Shut the Box: A text-based reproduction of a classic arithmetic game. This was for practicing my general Python skills.
- Complex Visualizer: A file for "graphing" complex functions in terms of angle and magnitude over the complex plane.
- Chess Knight: A program designed to help determine the average number of moves it takes for a knight starting in a corner of a chess board and moving randomly to return to its starting corner. Uses Markov chains as the primary theoretical basis.


## Work Projects
This is a collection of programs that I've written for my employment.

### LC-MS
A collection of files for managing LC-MS data.
- LC-MS_Parser: A file for cleaning and analyzing LC-MS and MS data using such tools as isotope envelopes and Principle Component Analysis.
- LC-MS_Plotter: A file for visualizing LC-MS data in three dimensions. This allows for a more interactive view than some industry software can provide but requires properly formatted data.

### Other
- TKG_csv_Resolver: Used to consolidate server user export files for the Bridge communications platform.
