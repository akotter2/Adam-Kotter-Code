# Adam-Kotter-Code
My repository for showcasing my different coding projects, divided into school projects, personal projects, and work projects. As of this writing I am in the process of cleaning up my file system, so some files may have incomplete descriptions or appear in the wrong place.

## Personal Projects

### RPG
This is a collection of files I'm using to create a text-based RPG in Python.

- Adam_Avatar: A saved character from tests of my RPG. This one is essentially equivalent to "God Mode."
- Battle Arena: The main file for gameplay of the RPG so far, consisting mostly of fights between characters. Later updates may involve a larger super file expanding gameplay to more exploratory things and including this file as a subset of the larger gameplay.
- Ghook_Orc: A saved character from tests of my RPG.
- Ghook_Orc_1: A saved character from tests of my RPG.
- Gimli_Dwarf: A saved character from tests of my RPG.
- Gimli_Dwarf_1: A saved character from tests of my RPG.
- Things: A file for storing information about the various items that can be used in the RPG.
- Tokens: A file for storing information about the various effects or "buffs" that can be placed on characters.

### Other
- Binary Converter: A file for converting real numbers into IEEE 754 representation. I wrote this mainly to make completeing a particular Applied and Computational Math assignment easier.
- Biology Life: A simple (and incomplete) game for modeling evolutionary fitness as a function of energy investment choices.
- Dice Modeler: A file for plotting the statistical probabilities of rolling certain amounts using different combinations of dice. Originally designed to make strategizing easier in roleplaying games.
- Evolution: An attempt at practicing with genetic algorithms.
- Planet Chooser: A statistical modeling game based on the mobile game "Seed Ship."
- Population Model: A file for modeling population growth using various different methods.




## School Projects
This is a collection of assignments I've completed for my Applied and Computational Math classes. It does not represent a full collection of what I've done.
- Linear Transformations: An assignment for practicing applications of linear transformations.
- Linked Lists: An assignment for practicing with different data structures.
- Markov Chains: An assignment for practicing using Markov Chains. I added several files of my own to practice more and create funny paragraphs and phrases that sound like my words or the words of others.
- Shut the Box: A text-based reproduction of a classic arithmetic game. This was for practicing my general Python skills.
- Complex Visualizer: A file for "graphing" complex functions in terms of angle and magnitude over the complex plane.

## Work Projects
This is a collection of programs that I've written for my employment. As of this writing, it contains one file (TKG_csv_Resolver.py) that I used to consolidate server user export files for Bridge.
